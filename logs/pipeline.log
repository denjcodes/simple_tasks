On top of the table, there is a white plastic container with a red lid, positioned in the center. The container has a distinctive shape, with a flat top and a curved bottom. It appears to be made of a smooth, glossy material.

Around the table, there are no other objects visible. The table itself is a dark brown color, with a circular shape and a raised edge. It appears to be made of a smooth, flat material, possibly wood or plastic.

There are no food, drinks, or decorations present on or around the table. The overall atmosphere suggests a clean and minimalist setting, with a focus on the central object.

Current Screen Description: On top of the table, there are three small, white containers with red labels. The containers are arranged in a triangular formation, with one at the front and two at the back. The front container is positioned directly in the center of the table, while the two containers at the back are slightly offset to the left and right sides of the table. The containers appear to be made of plastic or ceramic material and have a smooth, glossy finish. The red labels on the containers feature white text that is not legible due to the image quality. The table itself is round and has a dark brown color with a subtle sheen. It appears to be made of wood or a wood-like material and has a simple, minimalist design. The table is placed on a beige carpeted floor, which provides a neutral background for the scene. Overall, the image suggests a simple yet elegant setting, possibly a dining room or a living room.
2024-11-24 04:31:21,595 - task_breaker - INFO - Next Step: Excellent job describing the scene. You're on track to completing the task.

Now, let's start clearing the table. Remember, you need to pick up each container carefully by the lid.

**What to do next: Pick up the first container by the lid and move it off the table.**

In this case, the first container is the front container, which is directly in the center of the table. Try to grasp the lid firmly and gently lift the container, making sure not to spill its contents (if it has any). Move it to a nearby surface or a designated area.

Please describe the scene after you've moved the first container.

Current Screen Description: 

On top of the table, there are two white plastic containers with red lids. The containers are identical in shape and size, but the lid of one container is slightly more worn than the other. The containers are positioned in the center of the table, with one slightly closer to the camera than the other. 

Around the table, there are no visible objects such as food, drinks, or decorations. The table appears to be empty, with no signs of any items being placed on it. The background of the image shows a white wall with a black baseboard, and a brown carpeted floor. There are also some cords visible on the floor near the table, but they do not appear to be connected to any devices. Overall, the image suggests that the table is currently unused and free of any objects.
2024-11-24 04:32:15,355 - task_breaker - INFO - Next Step: You've got a clear view of the table. Now that you've got two containers on the table, let's focus on clearing the rest of the space.

**What to do next: Pick up the first of the two containers by the lid and move it off the table.**

In this case, since the containers are identical, it doesn't matter which one you choose to pick up first. Try to grasp the lid firmly and gently lift the container, making sure not to spill its contents (if it has any). Move it to a nearby surface or a designated area.

As you pick up the first container, remember to pay attention to its worn lid, so you can handle it with care.

Please describe the scene after you've moved the first container.

Current Screen Description: 

The image shows a round, dark brown table with a flat top and a thin, circular lip around the edge. The table is positioned at an angle, with the left side closer to the camera than the right side. 

On top of the table, there are two objects: a white plate and a glass. The plate is placed in the center of the table, while the glass is positioned slightly to the right of the plate. 

The plate appears to be made of ceramic or porcelain and has a wide rim. It is empty, with no food or drink visible on its surface. 

The glass is clear and has a cylindrical shape. It is filled with a dark liquid, possibly a beverage such as cola or soda. The glass is placed on a coaster or napkin, which is not clearly visible due to the image's low resolution. 

Around the table, there are several objects that appear to be decorations or accessories. These include a small, round vase with a few flowers, a candle, and a few pieces of fruit. The vase is placed on the right side of the table, near the glass. The candle is positioned on the left side of the table, near the plate. The fruit is arranged in a small bowl or basket, which is placed on the far side of the table. 

The background of the image is a plain white wall with a black baseboard. The floor is covered with a light-colored carpet or rug. Overall, the image suggests a casual dining setting, possibly in a home or restaurant.
2024-11-24 04:33:35,620 - task_breaker - INFO - Next Step: You're describing a new scene. I'll help you adjust your plan based on the description.

From your image description, I notice that there are objects on the table (the white plate, the glass, and nearby decorations like the vase, candle, and fruit), but I don't see the three small, white containers with red lids.

Let's start again from the beginning, based on the current state of the table.

**Look around the table and see what needs to be cleared**. Consider the objects you've described, like the white plate, the glass, the vase, the candle, and the fruit. Take note of their positions and appearances.

To clean the table effectively, we'll need to clear it of these objects. We can modify the original plan to accommodate this.

Here's your next step:

**What to do next: Choose an object to move first.** You can pick the object that seems easiest to move or the one closest to your current position. Please describe your chosen object and its position on or around the table.

We'll proceed from there, modifying the plan as needed to help you clean the table effectively.
