Please still pick up the glass cup, but this time, after you pick it up, let's take a closer look at the small stain. We might need to clean it before wiping down the table. Hold the cup in your hands carefully and examine the stain.

Let's see what you find out about the stain before we decide on the next step.

First, let's try to identify the objects on the table. You mentioned a partially visible rectangular object with a flat top and rounded edges, a circular object with a smooth surface, and a small white object resembling a paper clip.

Our goal is still to clean the table, but we need to figure out what these objects are and where they belong.

Please carefully pick up one of the objects, let's say the partially visible rectangular object with a flat top and rounded edges. Hold it in your hands and examine it closely.
